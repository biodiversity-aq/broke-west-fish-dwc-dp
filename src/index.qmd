## Introduction

This is an attempt to map BROKE-West Fish dataset as a marine [survey](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10YgbavCieUIpN_kNoHGHEkvILpFWCx8k-ZNXFVD4gSA/edit?usp=sharing) and [community measurements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rpxveUfN9MCdo38mJR0LaWerMo5Je0oL6p1Yym5gxH4/edit?usp=sharing) use case of the [new data model](https://www.gbif.org/composition/HjlTr705BctcnaZkcjRJq/gbif-new-data-model) to DwCAv2 and explore what information can be retrieve from DwCAv2.
