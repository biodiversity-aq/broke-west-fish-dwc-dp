target trawls on acoustically detected aggregations	Fish were caught using Rectangular Midwater Trawl nets (RMT 8 + 1), consisting of a RMT 1 mounted above a RMT 8 with a mouth area of 1 and 8m2 and a cod end mesh size of 0.33 and 0.85mm, respectively. Target trawls were not pre-planned and were aimed at acoustically detected aggregations. The net was lowered to the depth of the aggregation, and opened and closed remotely.Towing speed was approximately 2.5 knots (4.5 km h-1).

Pre-planned routine hauls with standard double oblique tow	Fish were caught using Rectangular Midwater Trawl nets (RMT 8 + 1), consisting of a RMT 1 mounted above a RMT 8 with a mouth area of 1 and 8m2 and a cod end mesh size of 0.33 and 0.85mm, respectively. Routine hauls consisted of a standard double oblique tow from the surface down to 200 m and back again to the surface. Towing speed was approximately 2.5 knots (4.5 km h-1).
