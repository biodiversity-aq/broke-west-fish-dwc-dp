# Exploring DwC-DP with marine community measurements dataset

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/916529634.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17266065)

This is an attempt to map a marine survey and community measurement dataset BROKE-West Fish to DwC-DP and explore what information can be retrieve from DwC-DP.

## Getting started

This project uses [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) to manage the dependencies in a virtual environment. Please try the following command to load the dependencies:

```
renv::restore()
```
The scripts in this repository were developed and tested using R version 4.5.1 (2025-06-13).
